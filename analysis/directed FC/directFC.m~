% Compute directed functional connectivity on a sliding window according to
% diferent mode of connectivity (inter, intra and pairwise channel)
%%% Input parameters: 
% - SSmodel : State space model  (envelope or ECoG) on slided time series.
%             SSmodel is a structure
%             with fields : A,V,C,K, model order and spectral radius
% - ichan     : selected paired channel for DFC
% 
%%% Output 
%
% - DFC: directed functional connectivity on slided window
% - mDFC: mean directed functional connectivity along sliding window
%
% TODO
% Condition on other channels
